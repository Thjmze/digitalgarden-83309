# Homebrew Rule Reference

## 1. Character Creation Rules
- Everyone gains one free feat at 1st level (cannot be traded for an ASI); the **Lucky** feat is banned.
- Variant Human/Custom Lineage  is not allowed.
- Ability scores must use **standard array** or **point-buy**.
- All class features, rolls, and stats must be on your Roll20 sheet, even if you also use D&D Beyond.
- Sessions proceed with at least four players present.
## 2. Resource & Equipment Simplifications
- Ammunition isn’t tracked; buy more whenever you visit a shop.
- Material components are ignored—except when you need an item over 100gp to complete the spell
## 3. Class-Specific Tweaks
### Barbarian
- Bonus Action: You may strike yourself, taking damage equal to **half your barbarian level (rounded up)** to keep Rage active.
## 4. Spell Variants
### Phantasmal Force
- The illusion can impose a fitting **secondary condition** (e.g., water-filled diving helmet → **Deafened**).
- An illusion cannot impose two conditions at the same time (eg. Iron Maiden can only impose either a. Restrained or b. Blinded)
- The phantasm **moves with the target** even if that creature moves 15 ft.; it exists only within the victim’s mind.
## 5. Skill & Insight Rules
- Insight checks are rolled **secretly**
## 6. Traps & Environmental Interactions
- **Trap “click”**: When a trap readies, everyone  within the trap's effective range hears a click and may take **one stationary reaction** (e.g., crouch, raise shield). The choice may raise or lower the trap’s save DC, depending on the trap. For example crouching may reduce the DC on an over-head trap but heighten the DC on a false-floor trap
- **Falling onto a creature**:
  • Target makes a Dex save.  
    – **Success**: You take normal fall damage; target shifts 5 ft. in any direction.  
    – **Failure**: Same, **plus** the target also takes **double** the fall damage you suffered.
## 7. Combat Actions & Mechanics
- **Natural 20 on Initiative**: You may place yourself anywhere in the initiative order.
- **Player Critical Hits**: Roll damage normally, then **add the maximum value of the damage dice**.  
  *Example: Longsword crit → 1d8 + STR + 8.*
- **Last Stand**: While making death saves you may instantly **fail 2** saves to take **one action** (no self-healing).  
  • Attacks auto-hit and crit.  
  • Spells are cast two levels higher without using a slot.
- **Flanking**: Grants the people on opposite sides of an enemy advantage. In addition, ranged attacks (ie more than 10ft away) gain a +2 to hit b/c imagine trying to defend two sides at once + getting shot at?? Sucks ass fr fr
- **Hidden HP & Death Saves**:  
  • HP is described narratively (“bleeding heavily”); numbers stay secret from other players.  
  • Death saves are rolled **to GM only**.  
  • *When casting a healing spell*, you may reveal HP to avoid overheal.
- **Healing Options**:  
  • **Out of combat**: all healing dice with the exception of short rest are treated as maximum.  
  • **In combat**: choose **bonus action (roll)** or **action (max)**
- **Magical Revival**: Any magical healing immediately restores consciousness if (1) HP regained exceeds negative HP **and** (2) incapacitation was caused by damage (not effects like *Hypnotic Pattern*).
## 8. Death & Narrative Flavor
- Whenever you roll a death save—pass **or** fail—describe a memory that flashes before your eyes.
