>- Session 12 Summary:
- After finishing a fight which involved one very unathletic guy tried to climb the Frostlance's walls (failed), he then jumped out of a window to try and avoid guards. Upon looking through the bodies, they find the criminals who attacked the train belong to the [[Compendium/Lore/Organizations/Iron Shadow\|Iron Shadow]] as they had seen in [[Session Notes/Session 07 (2025-04-26)\|Session 07 (2025-04-26)]]] .  The [[Compendium/Lore/Organizations/Sub One Club\|Sub One Club]] quickly realizes something is wrong with the engine as they hear the conductor/head engineer swearing from 3 cars up. As they advance towards the front, they are informed by Ellis Mualani that the lightning bolt used by [[Zarude\|Zarude]] resulted in the block within the engine to explode and damage the coal starter. She quickly explains that the coal starter is responsible for igniting large portions of coal for combustion and in its current state it can only ignite enough to sustain continous travel (not stopping for rest). As long as the train remains at a speed above 103km/hr, they are able to use the hybrid engine's feature of converting snow into mana for thrust.  She calls the railway equivalent of air traffic control (Central Railway Command) and the operator only speaks Elvish. With the assistance of [[Compendium/Party/Player Characters/Ellumin Watson\|Ellumin Watson]], they are told that the company does not want to send out a repair train all the way to the middle of [[Compendium/Atlas/Plane of Euthymia/Earthen Realm/Hanuel/Aargenbode/Aargenbode\|Aargenbode]] to fix the issue. Instead they are told to hope for the best and advance straight into [[Svalich\|Svalich]] and the capital city of [[Kleistwood\|Kleistwood]]. Central, Ellis Mualani, the coal starter assembly, the main drive is collapsed, stuck in snow at draft mode, at 103km/hr. 1800km away, at Kleisthold can repair it, but no repair train will come. As a result, Ellis looks at the train's power budgets and makes the unpopular decision to cut most of the train's services (such as hot meals or stabilizers for the cars) and let steerage roam the train freely. She explains the company will have compensation for all of the passengers and she hopes she won't get mutinied.  The train's primary source of income comes not from just transporting passengers but the cargo (a mysterious train car and 2 cars worth of coal). As they approach the station, a flood of reporters pesters the group with questions regarding a whole lot of things including why they didn't intervene to stop the murder of Tomie Topless, why they chose to take matters into their own hands in this incident instead of letting qualified technicans handle it and their names. Notably the party is extremely silent and withdrawn during this except for [[Compendium/Party/Player Characters/Johannes\|Johannes]] who gives a reporter his name and how they stopped the criminals "by shooting". After a trek to the [[Svalich Woods\|Svalich Woods]] in which they encountered a deer that [[Compendium/Party/Player Characters/Vivienne La Tour\|Vivi]] and some others helped to rescue from a bear trap (one they later discovered belonged to [[Baam\|Baam]]). After following a desire trail, they came to Baam's residence in the middle of these woods that had incredibly thin walls proven by the fact they could easily overhear [[Compendium/NPC's/Urek Mazino\|Urek Mazino]] and [[Baam\|Baam]] arguing about why Urek had broken into Baam's residence. Moreover, Urek is revealed to have connection with [[Compendium/NPC's/Sozantos\|Sozantos]]. Urek does not believe the party has what it takes (team cohesion or skill-wise) to succesfully infiltrate the Sinners but gives them a 10% cut after all thanks to some extremely high rolls (most notably from Johannes). Baam explains how the vaults of the Sinners requires two vault-breaking protocols to be completed in tandem with each other. One involves the party leading a blinded member through a maze whilst the maze deploys security protocols such as closing off exits or deploying monsters to attack the party member. The other involves a simple platform mini-game in which one party member has to switch between two maps to complete a puzzle. DM Note: these are just symbolic representations of vault-breaking and no [[Compendium/Party/Player Characters/Ellumin Watson\|Ellumin Watson]] you can't use blindsight on the labyrinth.
