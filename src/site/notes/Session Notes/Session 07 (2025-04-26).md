>Session 7 Summary:  The simulation begins. On choosing two fights, the party chooses the easier fight at first, and the harder fighter afterwards.  The easier fight is one against a captain of longer ago -  [[Compendium/Lore/Misc Lore/Cixen Liu\|Cixen Liu]].  The [[Compendium/Lore/Organizations/Iron Shadow\|Iron Shadow]] members are then met with a swift end, with the final foe dissolving in acid.  Two figures, a woman and child watch in the distance as the simulation ends, their faces sewen onto mannequins.    Immediately jumping into the next simulation, the party finds themselves at a dungeon named '[[The Ruins of Xilabia\|The Ruins of Xilabia]]'. Two guardians are in the ruins, named Bacchus and Argos, and the party is expected to undergo the test of Pythagoras - to defeat them in battle. A sharp volley of arrows come, hurting [[Compendium/Party/Player Characters/Card\|Card]], but the party makes quick work of Bacchus, and shifts over to Argos, who also shoots a lightning enchanted arrow into the air.  The arrow warps [[Compendium/Party/Player Characters/Card\|Card]] and [[Compendium/Party/Player Characters/Johannes\|Johannes]] to other spaces, where the fight continues. Unfortunately, both [[Compendium/Party/Player Characters/Johannes\|Johannes]] and [[Compendium/Party/Player Characters/Vivienne La Tour\|Vivi]] keep entering the wrong space to aid in the fight for a while, before finishing the combat simulation.   And so, the Sub One Club are now official adventurers in this world, able to take on commissions from the guild. There are currently three quests on the board that seem good: Catching a Frost Salamander for a date in 3 days, finding a missing tome with a modified Fireball spell, and an urgent quest for a crypt clearing.  There's also looking for [[Baam\|Baam]] and a few other projects, and so the party is left deliberating what to do.
