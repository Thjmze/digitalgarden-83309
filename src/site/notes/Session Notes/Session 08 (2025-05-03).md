> [!quote|no-t] SUMMARY
>Session 8 Summary:  The party decides to do some shopping before starting out on a quest. At the forge, managed by a fire elemental, [[Compendium/Party/Player Characters/Vivienne La Tour\|Vivi]] uses most of her money for additional weapons and armor, [[Compendium/Party/Player Characters/Card\|Card]] resupplies their javelins for a steal, and [[Compendium/Party/Player Characters/Johannes\|Johannes]] exchanges one of his revolvers with a hand crossbow, and accompanying ammo. At the magic item shop, managed by a harengon, [[Hon Rosie Booker\|Hon Rosie Booker]], who has a grandson who wants to enroll in a wizard's academy. Minthe talks about her own past as an artificer as well, buying a pair of night owl's half-moon spectacles and a stuffed familiar, with a luna moth cape on hold, and a glass carver watched. The artificer who made the glasses is named Luo Ji. She also lends Hon some teaching materials for the grandson.  Back at the adventurer's guild, Eleena (the one on the right, the one on the left is Allayna) is quite busy with other adventurers, and The Sub One Club officially accepts their first commission, to help a man get some frost salamander meat. On the way to the location of the salamander, they come across a group of drunken bards, and Vivi, Card, and Minthe get drunk, and Card taking an additional scotch, enters a nightmare of the past, where a dragon attacks a brewmaster's home.  
>> [!info]- Flashback  
> You feel a nauseating feeling come over you, your vision goes black and you wake up as a Brewmaster checking up on his wine cellar/distillery. You hear two giant booms outside and you rush to your bedroom door to look outside. When you look outside through your bedroom window, the sky is a deep shade of red and you see two extremely big pillars fashioned in the shape of hammers within 40km of your little abode. On top of it seems to be an object you can't make out. As you feel a small sense of safety, a dragon's claw seems to hit the top of this structure and a shockwave is created. You duck for cover as the glass of your window seems to shatter. Picking yourself up from the fragments, you see fire rapidly spreading out towards your home. The luscious green landscape now set ablaze (likely spread as a result of the shockwave)

>Entering the cave, the party comes across two frost salamanders. However, while it may seem some headway is made, the frost salamanders proved to be too much for the party, and so they made a hasty retreat to give a report to the adventurer's guild over a reassessment of the difficulty.
