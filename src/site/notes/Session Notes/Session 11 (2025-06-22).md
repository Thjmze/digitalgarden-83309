> [!quote|no-t] SUMMARY
>Card and the party go back to the Tavern. We discover [[Zarude\|Zarude]] has been banned from talking to women unoffically by the party as the women do not respond well to his charisma rolls (they secretly hate twinks obiviously). Mary the Tavernkeepers pours [[Compendium/Party/Player Characters/Card\|Card]] a fireball cinnamon whisky, and the party heads to the train station. When [[Compendium/Party/Player Characters/Ellumin Watson\|Ellumin Watson]] tried to intimidate [[Zarude\|Zarude]] into letting him pay for the tickets, Zarude does the classic fake stain fakeout on him, which defuses the situation. They board the standard cars (except for Zarude, who was rude and tried to get a luxury ticket). When they get onto the train, an announcer says it will take 5 days to reach the [[Svalich Woods\|Svalich Woods]]. Passengers are told to report to their beds, and the facilities will open for all passengers except for those in steerage.

> As they explore the train, they meet Mala, an aspiring unpaid intern squire to a knight. She was told by her parents to get a job over the summer and is far too weak to be lugging around all that equipment for her master. Despite this, she seems to have an unshakeable perseverance after she says, "I won't need luck, I will make my own." Ellumin helps Mala carry the knight’s luggage, and Zarude hands her a gold coin and wishes her luck.

> The team continues exploring the train and encounters a fortune teller whose name they never learn. [[Zarude\|Zarude]] reveals his mother was a fortune teller and believes her predictions were never wrong. The fortune teller charges them 5 silver each, under the guise of a heavy discount from 20 gold. She provides palm readings for the party, though Ellumin does not receive a fortune, as the teller disappears into smoke after touching him which Zarude says is a bad sign of [[Compendium/Party/Player Characters/Ellumin Watson\|Ellumin Watson]]'s future to come but [[Compendium/Party/Player Characters/Ellumin Watson\|Ellumin Watson]] can tell she is likely a fae. Star is revealed to have been born in a town called Lumina, where she was allowed to explore freely after informing the church in which she grew up. [[Compendium/Party/Player Characters/Card\|Card]] says she wants to become stronger, and the fortune teller warns her that she'll face many trials and tribulations before she can grow strong enough to protect those she loves. [[Compendium/Party/Player Characters/Star\|Star]] is told she will be a source of light for many people and should aid those who stray from it. [[Zarude\|Zarude]] receives shocking news that suggests the path he follows might not be right nor the organization (the Union) he is under.

> Eventually, it is time for food, and the party heads to the dining car. [[Compendium/Party/Player Characters/Vivienne La Tour\|Vivienne La Tour]] overhears two criminals, including one represented by Navia, whispering about robbing Fort Korihor which is underneath  a church , fearing being sent to "the Factory" if caught. [[Compendium/Party/Player Characters/Star\|Star]], [[Compendium/Party/Player Characters/Ellumin Watson\|Ellumin Watson]], and [[Zarude\|Zarude]] order the house special, frost salamander soup, while Vivi orders Harengon Coffee Carrots. During dinner, Vivi spots a faux blind man communicating via tapping code, possibly Morse, through his cane. Vivi interrupts by scoring the cane, disrupting the man's communication. This appears to be a local version of the thieves cant so [[Compendium/Party/Player Characters/Vivienne La Tour\|Vivienne La Tour]] is unable to exactly translate it. 
> 
> After dinner, Zarude enjoys an espresso at the cafe, and the party goes to sleep. The following day, during breakfast and coffee, [[Compendium/Party/Player Characters/Ellumin Watson\|Ellumin Watson]] notices the vibrations of the train feel wrong. Drawing from his military experience and familiarity with this train, he senses an issue with the fuel intake valve. They head past the crew quarters and the kitchen, where crew members try to stop them but are intimidated by [[Compendium/Party/Player Characters/Johannes\|Johannes]]. At the engine, they find the chief engineer desperately trying to fix a blockage. Ellumin detects a 60% obstruction that won’t budge despite a normal air flush procedure. Upon casting detect magic, [[Compendium/Party/Player Characters/Ellumin Watson\|Ellumin Watson]] realizes the obstruction is magical, pulsating conjuration magic, and likely a bomb. The situation worsens as the engine emits unusual gray smoke. [[Zarude\|Zarude]] shoots a lightning bolt, assisted by Ellumin, dislodging and destroying the blockage.
> Meanwhile, the door to the crew quarters is locked, and intruders who entered through the roof barricade themselves inside. They don't seem interested in direct combat but scatter fruit and flip tables to slow pursuit. [[Compendium/Party/Player Characters/Johannes\|Johannes]] shoots two intruders in the head, as [[Compendium/Party/Player Characters/Card\|Card]] breaks down the door. They discover these bandits are brutal, using civilian bodies to obstruct the [[Compendium/Lore/Organizations/Sub One Club\|Sub One Club]]’s path. The session ends with guards summoned by the crew storming in to assist against these violent intruders.
