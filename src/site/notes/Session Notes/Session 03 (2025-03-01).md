> [!quote|no-t] SUMMARY
>We come across various letters between a cryptologist, [[Thrain Farbe\|Thrain Farbe]], and their wife, [[Laika Spades\|Laika Spades]], posthumously. They have died for a while, and Laika comes to them eventually after their death, urging further explorers to kill [[UMA Colour\|UMA Colour]] and destroy the ruins. In the letters, [[Thrain Farbe\|Thrain]] becomes insane over the removal of the barriers and the colours.
>[[Compendium/Party/Player Characters/Star\|Star]], throwing herself in danger, almost falls into a spike trap, gets run over by a spiky rock, and by being raised in a temple, does not know Chinese. Unfortunate. 
>After one colourful light puzzle, the door opens and turns transparent, as we find [[Calysta\|Calysta]], trapped by coloured ropes on an altar. She was constantly begging for help. It felt very cliche, and in fact, felt too cliche. So instead, the party futzed around for a really long time holding open a door, digging a hole, and finding a letter which indicates that Laika rigged traps within the ruins, the same traps the party (or more specifically, Star) has encountered.
>Turns out, [[UMA Colour\|UMA Colour]] disguised itself as [[Calysta\|Calysta]], and so the party fought (minus [[Compendium/Party/Player Characters/Vivienne La Tour\|Vivi]] who was still trying to keep a door open). Star immediately collapsed right in front of the boss. [[Compendium/Party/Player Characters/Johannes\|Johannes]] nearly got downed. [[Vivienne La Tour  \|Vivienne La Tour  ]] finally opened that door and dealt the final blow to [[UMA Colour\|UMA Colour]].
