## The Chain of Acheron 
Acheron McTavish, the king who forged the  Chain of Acheron possessed or was speculated to possess the UnSleep [[Compendium/Lore/Misc Lore/negator\|negation]] which rendered him unable to sleep and gave him more time to devote to his craft of blacksmithing. This did not bode well for his small kingdom that was eventually reduced down to just a few hundred men during the Periamble War (a war fought against his nation and an unknown sentient white humanoid enemy called the Periamble) but did allow him enough time to create the powerful weapon that has since passed through the hands of many. Scholarly sources greatly differ in how they represent the Periamble as very little is known about them. The general consenus is either they must have risen from the [[Unspoken Ocean\|Unspoken Ocean]] or from an area of desolate land covered in ice and snow as the [[Blank\|Blank]].  The Chain of Acheron itself is an equally strange weapon that has always passed through too many criminal hands for any scholarly source to study. After all, with power like that, why bother using it for anything but domination? These are fragmented historical records of reported sightings (though not all may be reliable). 

_“It was as if he [likely McTavish] commanded his entire legion as one entity—an eerie unity that defied all reason.”_ - Refugee from the fallen kingdom

_“When Supreme Knightmaster Zodd wielded the Chain, my very will to resist dissolved. Speaking out of turn felt like a sentence to the Nine Hells.”_ - Former member of the notorious Effigies criminal group

_“I watched a spy, unshakable for years, fold and betray his homeland mere moments after the Chain touched him.”_ - Anonymous torturer with the [[Compendium/Lore/Organizations/Iron Shadow\|Iron Shadow]]

_“The metal itself defies all attempts to break or melt it. I shattered obsidian knives trying to chip even a sliver and hid the damage from my boss. My forge had to burn hotter than the fires of [[Compendium/Lore/Deities/Agni\|Agni]] to even soften it. When I alloyed it with brittle pewter, the resulting blade was sharper than even tempered  Steel.”_ - Unknown criminal blacksmith

The Chain’s most terrifying attribute is its power over the minds and bodies of those it touches. Acheron McTavish’s warriors consented to wield it, yet the weapon effectively puppeteers its victims—forcing their movements into uncanny, preternatural coordination before death and even beyond. This control ends only when a particular bone shatters—a dark secret lost to history. But it too can also extract information straight from the soul, even if it is buried under layers of mental defenses or "forgotten" from their active memory. 

UnSleep, meanwhile, is no ordinary insomnia. It grants a ghastly resilience, forcing the body to endure on mere seconds of sleep at a time. McTavish himself lived thirty restless years, said to sleep only in the fleeting few seconds between the striking of hammer against metal and the subsequent period in which it would cool before it may be struck again. 

He died on the battlefield, last of his people, fighting the final Periamble soldier—his sacrifice buying enough time for survivors to flee. But the Chain of Acheron remains a dreadful legacy and has passed through the hands of many criminals. It currently resides in the vault of the [[Sinners\|Sinners]]
