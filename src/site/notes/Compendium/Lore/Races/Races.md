#race 
## Dragonborn 
Often rare in number and rarer still in appreciation, dragonborn are exiled by both humans and dragons-alike. For being a dragonborn meant a human and dragon had to mate. The countless casualties that lay in the many battlefields of humans and dragonkind alike as a result of conflict between the two sour the taste of many rural-folk towards those borne of the mixing of draconic and human lineage. Similar disdain is had for draconic sorcerers if they are human. 

However, in general the dragons have often only pillaged primarily human settlements and the only ones that send adventurer's of a serious enough calibre to injure a dragon would be humans. It is said in folk tale that the first dragonborn was widely celebrated. Thousands of years ago, the first real war against dragons led by humanity was abruptly ended when the queen of the warring human nation of Kefer revealed her daughter was pregnant with the child of a dragon. Being such a novel occurrence, the dragon king, Atorvastat, chose to hold off the war until the child grew into adulthood (whether that be the 18 years for humans, 100 years for dragonkind or somewhere in between). In the meantime, the kingdom blossomed with trade between the two nations and many dragon-children were conceived (as much as 100 according to now antiquated records). Though it was not without hardship, despite the newfound friendship, the child who's name was forcibly erased from history grew unhappy. It possessed naught the intellect/wisdom of the dragons but it did possess their strength. It did not possess the weakness of the humans but it did possess their bravery and battle hunger. For him, peace was a war in his mind that he could not win. So he began to sow discord within the ranks of both nations that had welcomed him with open arms. In naught but 30 years after the peace accords were signed, civil war laid waste to many caught in its crossfire. Families turning against one another, star-struck lovers striking their beloved and trust eroding quickly. If it wasn't for the clever detective work of a Gregory Home, the true culprit behind the civil war, the once beloved dragonborn child, would not have been found. He was put to death and everything that bore his name was stripped from the record. Considering he bore the 9th popular boy's name at the time, this resulted in an extensive wiping of many crucial parts of history. Even following his death, neither side wished to admit it was their fault that this boy had committed such an atrocity. Reeling after the loss of many lives, they blamed the dragonborn children for their downfall. Each side believing them to have some sort of allegiance to the other side (though in their hearts they knew this was false). Dragonborn as a result often wear hoods when talking to countryfolk and hide their stature behind imposing suits of armour. That's not to say their entire reputation is bad though. Following the retirement of [[Compendium/Lore/Misc Lore/Cixen Liu\|Cixen Liu]], King Irmin appointed [[Escito the brave\|Escito the brave]] to be head of [[Swordfish 2\|Swordfish 2]]. Thanks to Escito the brave's handiwork as the head of [[Swordfish 2\|Swordfish 2]], people saw Dragonborn in another light. As great knights who did not hesitate to charge in battle and deliver devastating blows against the criminal underbelly of [[Compendium/Atlas/Plane of Euthymia/Earthen Realm/Hanuel/Dornfells/Dornfells\|Dornfells]] such as the [[Compendium/Lore/Organizations/Iron Shadow\|Iron Shadow]].

#race 
## Dwarves

Often found scattered across the world, Dwarves are known for their lively humor, their intricate craftsmanship and of course their mighty beards. Dwarves have been around for so long that little is known of their orgins. As the second oldest species (or third if you ask Elven anthropologists), Dwarves were foundational in many construction or crafting techniques used today. Their short stature made them excellent miners from the [[diamonds\|diamonds]] found miraculously in  the [[Arkane\|Arkane]] region to the cold icy tundras of the [[Compendium/Atlas/Plane of Euthymia/Earthen Realm/Hanuel/Jadagarr/Jadagarr\|Jadagarr]] territory, if there is an industry that needs miners or smiths, you will find atleast one dwarf there. There is a saying from before [[Compendium/Lore/Events/Ragnarok\|Ragnarok]] that went something like this "You could journey amongst the stars, land upon the grandest mountain and planet you have ever seen and at the base will be a dwarf mining for who knows what!". The saying's origin is unknown but the sentiment of Dwarves being anywhere and everywhere has been propagated for as long as history has been recorded. Their short stature betrays their impressive muscular density and metabolism. Dwarves often have 2 stomachs (literally) that help them digest and excrete food at a much faster rate than most. Impressively, in situations of extreme survival, it is said your average dwarven man could stay fed off a single slab of meat and a meagre slice of bred for a week before he hungers again. Now this isn't entirely accurate as this man would have to be practically comatose to complete such a feat but it is a testament to their natural aptitude for survival. Jokingly called beavers, they gain a deep primal satisfaction from construction and bending nature to their whim than even humans! However, some rural settlements utterly despise dwarves as people of all races trust Dwarven techniques over many others. Likewise they believe Dwarven handiwork to be superior to any other. This often results in the erasure of traditional techniques that may or may not be better than Dwarven techniques. 
Dwarves who take up the adventuring life might be motivated by a desire for treasure-for its own sake, for a specific purpose, or even out of an altruistic desire to help others. Other dwarves are driven by the command or inspiration of a deity, a direct calling or simply a desire to bring glory to one of the dwarf gods. Clan and ancestry are also important motivators. A dwarf might seek to restore a clan's lost honor, avenge an ancient wrong the clan suffered, or earn a new place within the clan after having been exiled. Or a dwarf might search for the axe wielded by a mighty ancestor, lost on the field of battle centuries ago.
Dwarves can live to be more than 400 years old, so the oldest living dwarves often remember a very different world. For example, some of the oldest dwarves living in Citadel Felbarr (in the world of the Forgotten Realms) can recall the day, more than three centuries ago, when orcs conquered the fortress and drove them into an exile that lasted over 250 years. This longevity grants them a perspective on the world that shorter-lived races such as humans and halflings lack.
Dwarves are solid and enduring like the mountains they love, weathering the passage of centuries with stoic endurance and little change. They respect the traditions of their clans, tracing their ancestry back to the founding of their most ancient strongholds in the youth of the world, and don't abandon those traditions lightly. Part of those traditions is devotion to the gods of the dwarves, who uphold the dwarven ideals of industrious labor, skill in battle, and devotion to the forge.
Individual dwarves are determined and loyal, true to their word and decisive in action, sometimes to the point of stubbornness. Many dwarves have a strong sense of justice, and they are slow to forget wrongs they have suffered. A wrong done to one dwarf is a wrong done to the dwarf's entire clan, so what begins as one dwarf's hunt for vengeance can become a full-blown clan feud.

#race 
### Elves 
Elves proclaim themselves the second oldest species of this Earth. Unlike Dwarves, their origins are quite clear atleast in their shared mythology. They say when a drop of Rukkadevata's blood was first dropped onto Earth, it fell into the region now known as "[[The Glass\|The Glass]]". A freezing cold lake that would suck up the very moisture of anyone who dared to step into it, they say it was the coldest part of existence, even colder than the outer-planar battleground of [[Rukkadevata\|Rukkadevata]] and [[Compendium/Lore/Deities/Agni\|Agni]]. So when the fire-y hot blood of Agni dropped into the lake, it was so hot it boiled the lake and the droplet alongside it. The condensed vapour turned the whole lands around into into an icy tundra where before temperate rainforest had permeated the area. Naturally considering the blood of a dragon is the basis for [[Compendium/Lore/Misc Lore/Magic\|Magic]], the last non-liquid residues of this droplet in the lake bore new life. A life that was forged out of magic and one that embodied the elegance of the art. At this time, magic as a field wasn't even around so it created beings who had a fractional amount of magic within their systems pulsating with power. This power led them not astray as it does for many races but instead it led them down the path of civilization building. This is often why Dwarves and Elves fight over the title of the second civilization as early Dwarven civilizations were primarily built underground whilst the  Elves built them overground. Considering the humans also stuck to the surface, human records showcase Elven development being the first but that is contrasted by Dwarven claims of first settlement in the region of [[Adimeskha\|Adimeskha]]. Their personal interconnection with magic and their claims of being the second oldest civilization have led them to conflict with the Dwarves though they do not bear much hatred for each other. An interesting fact about their magical origins is that they do not feel the need to sleep. This was a plague amongst early Elven societies as many would still tire and die after countless sleepless nights. When considered in conjunction with their meagre populations, long life spans and low birth rate: this almost led to the collapse of the earliest signs of Elven civilization before it had even started. It was only thanks to humans who when they integrated some Elven strays into their human society and mannerisms (such as sleep) that the Elven technique of "Trance" or deep meditation was discovered. This unique method of recovery allows for replenishment of stamina at twice the rate of most races. This combined with their relatively low muscularity has led to Elves being a creative powerhouse and in sometimes within scholarly fields too. They share a deep bond with humans as the first Elven civilization did indeed collapse. It was the ones who intersected with the humans that managed to survive and thrive + eventually create their own civilizations. While too extensive to get into much detail about, the Drow are the most interesting and unfortunate to note in terms of civilization. They had gotten separated during a long voyage from what we now know as [[Salskirk\|Salskirk]] to discover what lay beyond the land. It was there they would enter through an untraceable phenemonon (some scholars believe it to be a magic leakage of sorts while others postulate it might have been divine intervention) causing their physiology to mutate rapidly. This rapid mutation is what is believed to have led to the creation of the [[Compendium/Atlas/Plane of Euthymia/Earthen Realm/Gondwana/Dravinslagg/Dravinslaggian\|Dravinslaggian]] civilization or as it was known back then Methylphen. This mutation affected different elves in different ways hence the creation of the species of Lizardfolk, hobgoblins/goblins, bugbears and Yuan-Ti alongside the Drow. However, this is still merely conjecture as it could be that sapient life evolved within the [[Compendium/Atlas/Plane of Euthymia/Earthen Realm/Gondwana/Dravinslagg/Dravinslaggian\|Dravinslaggian]] empire on its own. But the sporadic nature of multiple convergent evolutions where one should have outcompeted the other is highly suspect and most scholars in genealogy agree on this common consensus. 

##### Common misconception: Elves are haughty but not unkind
There is a stereotype perpetuated in certain sects or communities that Elves believe themselves superior to most if not all (with the notable exception of humans). That is true. What is not true is the belief that Elves treat others disrespectfully as a result. Most Elves do indeed believe themselves superior and some go so far as to believe others are tools or pawns to be used. HOWEVER, a tool must be well cared for or else it will break or dull. Even the most pretentious and ethnocentric elves treat others with some respect as it serves them well to curry favor with the most powerful factions or the lowly working class. The wood elves specifically showcase this behaviour (rare though they might be) in how they hunt/fish/settle in a fashion so sustainable the surrounding environment often grows more lucious near their camps. This isn't to say they aren't above prejudice as many wood elves are naturally distrustful of those who look like them. A big part of this is because wood elves (though they will not admit it) had evolved in different conditons when they were banished from the largest Elven-Human settlement in the times of old, usually for frivolous crimes that had no reason to come attached with exile. An example of one of these crimes would be "wearing a red top with a green bottom" or "having a untethered flying creature on Saturdays". Regardless, though the exact reasons are oft forgotten, in their instincts there is a distrust for the elegant graceful appearance of the humanoid factions. Some wood elven tribes or clans will go so far as to mutilate themselves into unwieldy forms. 

### Half-Elves
Half-elves unlike dragonborn aren't feared, or treated any differently than regular Elves. While they do not share enough magical potential to trance, they are a natural byproduct of civilizations that have co-existed and procreated with each other for a long time. The only ones you will see begrudging those of this mixed ancestry are the most proud and arrogant of Elven and Humankind alike.

#race 
## Halflings

Halflings are a distinctive, yet often enigmatic, race closely resembling humans but characterized primarily by their notably short stature. Despite their widespread presence across most human societies, the origins of halflings remain shrouded in mystery and subject to much debate. Historical and genealogical records rarely provide clear evidence tracing their lineage, largely due to their close physical and cultural proximity to humans, making it difficult to distinguish halflings as a separate people in early documents.
Origins and Theories

The prevailing theories regarding the origins of halflings fall into several camps:

Human Descent with Genetic Variation: Many scholars believe halflings are simply humans with a rare genetic mutation resulting in their diminutive size, akin to forms of natural dwarfism but without the associated health issues. This view is supported by their overwhelming integration and similarity in values and social structures with mainstream human populations.

Hybrid Descent Hypothesis: Some speculate halflings might be descendants of crossbreeding between humans and [[Compendium/Lore/Races/Dwarves\|Dwarves]], given certain overlapping traits such as resilience and a sturdy constitution. However, no documented cases exist of halflings born directly to dwarven parents, casting doubt on this theory. It is possible that such myths arise from the cultural proximity and occasional physical resemblance between halflings and dwarves.

Recessive [[Compendium/Lore/Races/Dwarves\|Dwarven]] Lineage Theory: A more subtle theory suggests that halflings could inherit their stature from a recessive gene introduced into human bloodlines generations ago by a distant dwarven ancestor. This might explain sporadic appearances of halfling traits without direct dwarf parentage, though the lack of concrete genetic studies leaves this unconfirmed.

Halflings coexist with [[Compendium/Lore/Races/Humans\|humans]] with relatively little social friction. Their values, lifestyles, and aspirations tend to align closely with those of humans, contributing to their acceptance as quiet, unassuming members of society. They are known for their tendency to live in homes far larger than their own size would seem to require, sometimes leading to whimsical anecdotes about halflings “lost in their own houses.” Despite their peaceful coexistence and lack of ambition for dominance or conflict, halflings occupy a somewhat ambiguous social position. They are generally regarded without contempt but rarely with significant admiration or respect. Their unremarkable presence in historical records and notable achievements has led many to view them as minor figures in the grand narrative of the world and Prejudice. In particular, dwarven communities hold a notably critical view of halflings. Halflings are often seen by dwarves as a diluted or lesser reflection of dwarven heritage—a “pale imitation,” as some describe them. This prejudice is encapsulated in the words of Hafthor, a prominent [[Compendium/Lore/Races/Dwarves\|Dwarven]] manager, who once said:

“Name a single Halfling inventor! What about a great politician halfling? They’ve done nothing evil and accomplished nothing great. I would never hire a halfling for something in which I desire perfection. Quite frankly, I do not believe them capable of greatness. They are mediocre creatures who live mediocre lives.”
Such sentiments, while harsh, are alarmingly common not only among dwarves but also echoed in wider society, albeit often in a more muted form. This general perception of halflings as unambitious or unexceptional has contributed to their societal invisibility, despite their contributions in more humble or localized spheres such as farming, small trade, and community life.

#race 
## Half orc

Half-orc is actually an unrepresentative term for members of this race born out of an early slur used by certain communities to refer to them. Orcs in general are unintelligent and generally represent the likes of monsters that [[Adventurer’s Guild\|Adventurer’s Guild]]s would slay or send out. However, one tribe of orcs that had somehow wandered ashore into [[Impasi\|Impasi]] seemingly grew more intelligent overnight. They did not have much of a record-keeping culture established and they still continued like regular orcs do for a fair amount of time. During this time due to their superior intellect allowing them to avoid walking into traps, hunt easier targets and copy tried-and-tested practices from human or elven hunter nearby, they rapidly grew in number and developed their own variant of common with unique grammatical structures that focused on efficiency in communication over pleasantries (like the Elven common variant). Eventually, it is assumed they had made friends with one of the civilized races (though it is unsure which one) and integrated into the culture. For a long time, no records were kept about them or their presence in records were altered to show different races. Gradually as their numbers grew and they became an increasingly large portion of the workers in fields such as construction or manual labour, so too did the respect they were owed. A half-orc was thought of (and rightfully so!) as a sure-fire way to get a job done well and fast unless you were looking for friendly chatter along the way. Most of the research into their cultural origins only started within the last 30 years and thus not much else is really known about them. Generally half-orcs stay out of academia but they are known for their exceptional adventuring skills. Strong in musculature and of considerable heft, often times people are somewhat cautious around them. The more ethnocentric populations believe them to be mindless brutes who are faking their intelligence so they can launch a suprise attack on an unsuspecting person. This is naturally false but these fears do still exist in certain parts of the population. The term "half-orc" came from the belief that despite them being civilized, they should still be treated as being just as brutish as orcs.

#race 
## Tieflings

If Half-orcs or Dragonborn face quiet bigotry, then Tieflings are the ones who have to see hatred in its ugliest form. Tieflings are borne not always through reproduction. While two tieflings procreating can produce a tiefling, the genome isn't strong enough to create a mixed race or to over-ride the genetic traits of a non-tiefling partner so tieflings can only continue their bloodline if they find a fellow tiefling to reproduce with. That is not the point that invites bigotry, the part about tieflings people hate is the fact they are the only race that you can give birth to without conceiving with them. The mechanism is unknown but since the Tieflings are suspected to be of the same origin as devils, when they die unlike most their souls do not pass on to whatever afterlife may await. Unlike those that become part of the undead, Tieflings also do not inhabit a ghostly shell either. Instead, a Tiefling soul will aimlessly wander around until it finds a woman pregnant with child and "infect" it. In essence, the child becomes another Tiefling despite the mother never having had sexual contact with a Tiefling. This alongside their devilish appearance has led to them being feared as a disgusting abomination and for robbing mothers of the chance to have a "normal" child. As a result, many tieflings are persecuted and those who aren't only manage to avoid the ire of the general populace with their extreme amount of charisma that they've developed as a coping mechanism. Prior to the knowledge of their reproduction being widespread (and even in current day amongst lesser educated people), a tiefling child was believed to be a curse for a great mortal sin that the mother or father of that child had committed. For most tieflings, coming from a stable home that loves them might be too much to ask or even hope for. This is also why Tieflings are often seen in criminal organizations that promise them freedom from judgement. 

However, this problem is somewhat alleviated as population density increases. Certain cities are amicable to Tieflings and this is where they thrive. Thanks to their devilish charms, Tieflings make excellent bards and performers. Not only that but politicans, lawyers and practically any profession that utilizes their charismatic nature. Though their charisma isn't entirely due to just their bloodline. Tieflings find that if they are charismatic enough, they can often overturn the connotations of negativity people have against them. Unfortunately, due to their method of reproduction though it is not by choice, they still face ire in many places. 

### The Genocide of Sebeth
Disputed amongst scholars on whether to classify it as a genocide or not, the Genocide of [[Sabeth\|Sabeth]] was an atrocity that took place 10,000 years PR (Pre-[[Compendium/Lore/Events/Ragnarok\|Ragnarok]]) before the scientific community understood how Tieflings are produced, mothers who gave birth to a Tiefling child were considered to be immoral pleasure seekers that couldn't help themselves and were given divine punishment as a result. Armed with this belief, it was ruled that those who bore a Tiefling child, should not be allowed to reproduce as they must carry evil within their very veins. Moreover, Tieflings themselves were considered a product of evil and thus must not be allowed to continue their bloodline either. In the small kingdom of [[Compendium/Atlas/Plane of Euthymia/Earthen Realm/Pangea/Luoth/Luoth\|Luoth]], this meant women who gave birth to a Tiefling were spayed so they could procreate no longer. However, after the twin birth of Cassandra Petravic, who gave birth to a tiefling child and a human child: it was deemed Tiefling-ism must be a recessive trait passed down through bloodlines. When combined with the fact Tiefling offspring (if their partner is of non-tiefling origin) do not share or resemble the traits of their Tiefling parent, this led to the Genocide of Sebeth for Tieflings. This meant Tieflings across the kingdom were rounded up and forced to be spayed or castrated to prevent their reproduction. Many scholars consider this to be a full-on genocide and as such deem the Kingdom of [[Compendium/Atlas/Plane of Euthymia/Earthen Realm/Pangea/Luoth/Luoth\|Luoth]] pay reparations for this vile act. Espescially considering the Tieflings were told that they would be given reparations for the prejudice against them as a way to round them up for this genocide.
