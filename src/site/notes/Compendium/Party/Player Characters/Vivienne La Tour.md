> A lover of adventure since she was young, this half-elf woman was once a drifter of various adventuring academies until one fateful day she took her fate into her own hands and formed an adventuring party with a particular bard. Though that's not to say she didn't dabble in some other disciplines like alchemy. In fact, prior to being picked up by this party, she had worked under her teacher who had tasked her with creating a tool that could be useful to adventurers so even if she couldn't make it as an adventurer herself, she could still help indirectly but ultimately she couldn't afford to be pursue the path of the artifice.  Regardless, the party she formed was nothing more than a  group of eclectic adventurers including a bard she couldn't help but slowly develop a fondness for. After many years, the party  had cultivated a wealth  of experience  and functioned like a well-oiled artifice but one day they went on an uncertain adventure. Fate was not favorable towards  them that day as the expedition went disastrously wrong whilst leaving only one survivor: Vivienne. Her mind broken by survivor's guilt and the people blaming her for the events that transpired, she unlocked her inherent ability to turn invisible. From then onwards, she has always felt like she was invisible. Until of course, one day when she noticed an entity she would deem Mirielle Camu running towards the [[Compendium/Lore/Misc Lore/Lore In Campaigns Past/portal\|portal]] and when she followed her in, for the first time in a while: people could perceive her. 

### Mirille Camu
>Mirielle is moreso a subconscious imaginary friend, though, not made up on purpose.

#### Appearance
> Her eyes are blue when she is not using her soul-knife abilities while her eyes are purple  when she is using her soul form.
